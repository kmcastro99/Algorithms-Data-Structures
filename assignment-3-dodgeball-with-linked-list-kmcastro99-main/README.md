# Assignment 3

Assignment 3 for MSCI 240 Data Structures and Algorithms.

This assignment involves implementing linked data structures to solve the same Dodgeball problem as in Assignment 2.


## Launch Configurations

There are two launch configurations (visible in `.vscode/launch.json`):

 - `DodgeballMain interactive` runs an interactive session with expected input from the terminal.
 - `DodgeballMain file input` runs an interactive session with expected input `input.txt`.

You may modify `input.txt` or change/add launch configurations as you test and debug. You can do this by modifying `launch.json`.

If you wish to run things on your own, you can directly run `dodgeball_main.py`, the main function for this class.


## Unit tests

There are several unit tests for this assignment that test a *subset* of your required methods. You will need to complement this testing with interactive testing.

You can find these in the VS code testing module, and configure them in `settings.json` if you run into trouble.


## Running experiments

You do not need to run any experiments for this assignment involves. However, if you wish, you can edit and run `run_experiments.py`, and comment/uncomment out various parts of the code as needed to run it.
