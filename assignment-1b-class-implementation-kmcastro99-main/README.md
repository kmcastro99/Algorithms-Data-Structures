# A1-template

This is a starting template for MSCI 240 Assignment 1 (Python). You should replace these instructions with a discription of your class and build instructions.


# Class Description

This class provides information of different scientific calculators that can be found in a supply retail store such as Staples. The class has four private fields which are: the calculator brand (e.g Casio, HP, Sharp, etc), the models which are mapped to their prices, their available functionalities (perform math operations, matrix operations, and root finding operations), and the state of the calculator whether if it is working or not. The class can access the four private fields by using accessor methods per field. And the class also has three mutator methods for adding new models, updating a model price, and for changing the state of the calculator in case one of the functionality test fails. Finally, the class has methods for performing basis mathematical operations, matrix operations. The outcomes of testing these operations will determine the state of the scientific calculator.


# Test Instructions

Run the run_test.py file


# Build Instructions

The space analysis example program is performed automatically once the ScientificCalculator.py program is run. After the ScientificCalculator.py file is run, 4 plots will be displayed (2 scatter plots for both empirical and simplified model and 2 line graphs for both models). The memory (bytes) will be printed for each class instance (6 in total) for both models. 

Your environment needs to have numpy and matplotlib libraries in order to run


# Acknowledgements

As mentioned in the report, the numpy and matplotlib documentations were used.
